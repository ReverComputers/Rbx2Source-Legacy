Rbx2Source Legacy
=====================
A fixed version of version 1.60 of Rbx2Source. I used the deafult version (all I did was change the link it wants to access
, pretty easy right?) Anyways, I will put the realeases in the releases corner so you do not have to deal with downloading it from the repo.

Just wanna say that I saw a license in a earlier commit, so I'll be putting it here so I do not get in trouble.
I also have to credit CloneTrooper1019 and gamenew09 for making Rbx2Source!
(all I did was copy and change the license from a another github repo about Creative Commons. Also I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO LICENSE SO FORGIVE ME IF I GET THIS WRONG)
